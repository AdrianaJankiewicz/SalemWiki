		    <p>Anne Hale is one of the main female characters of Salem. She is a daughter of Magistrate Hale and Countess Von Marburg, but she believed to be the daughter of Mrs. Hale. She is also the wife of Cotton Mather and sister to Sebastian Von Marburg. She takes care of children in the orphanage after her close friend died. <br> Magistrate Hale and Anne were send to Salem, Massachusetts by Countess Marburg to escape the witch persecutions in Europe. Her father later married Mrs. Hale and as a child, Anne was raised never knowing of her true mother. While she was growing up, her father used to take her to a hidden room to teach her about music and art, something that was not tolerated by Puritans. She was aware of her powers as a child as she moved her toys telekinetically, but Magistrate made her forged until she was ready to remember and face her powers. <br> She was born from a witch bloodline, making her a cradle witch. Tituba mentioned that Anne's bloodline is one of the oldest and highest among the witches. Her mother is one of the last legendary ancient witches making Anne very powerful threat.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The character's description on Official Instagram is as follows: <em>"Anne Hale: the pure witch tainted by dark powers."</em></li>
				
				<li><br>Anne Hale's character is described as <em>A fearless girl, Anne Hale is a beautiful, talented artist with a perilous attraction to the newly arrived John Alden.   A passing vision that makes the ladies envious and men fall in love; Anne is always testing boundaries – so much so that it deeply concerns the Puritans.   Since she is the daughter of the powerful Magistrate Hale, people expect her to behave in a certain way.  However, Anne is a rebel who doesn’t like to play by the town’s old rules."</em></li>
			
				<li><br>It seems there is no counterpart of Anne Hale in real life Salem Witch Trials.</li>
