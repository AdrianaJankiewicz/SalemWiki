			    <p>Mary Sibley is the female protagonist of the series Salem. She is the wife of George Sibley, a counselor and head of the selectmen, the lover of John Alden, as well as the most powerful witch. She got her powers after she sacrificed her unborn child to Satan. <br> She was born and raised in Salem, Massachusetts. At some point in her childhood, her parents bought a slave girl Tituba who quickly forged a strong relationship with Mary, often treating each other like sisters. <br> Mary and young John Alden quickly fall in love, however, he is later sent to fight in the nine years war. He made a vow to Mary that he will return within a year and as a promise he gave her half of a silver coin. A few months later, she discovered she was pregnant with John's baby. Manipulated by witches, she believed that John died during the war and she sacrificed an unborn child to the Devil, becoming a witch herself. Sometime later, she married George Sibley after witches poisoned his previous wife. Within first years of their marriage, she placed her husband under a spell, wanting revenge on the man and leaving her in control of Salem.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Mary Sibley is described as: <em>Beautiful, ruthless and vulnerable, Mary Sibley is Salem’s most powerful enchantress, with a deep secret and deeper desires that may threaten her position and strength.  Both villainess and heroine – she is always the center of attention. Mary uses her position of power and influence not only to promote her personal ascension within Salem, but to wreak revenge upon those whose hypocrisy and cruelty lead Mary to her current struggles. When John Alden returns, it turns her world upside down.  No matter how tough she is, Alden nearly derails everything, causing long-dormant emotions to resurface with a dizzying vengeance. Regardless of whom she truly loves, her husband or John, Mary may well be bound by ties even deeper to someone – or something – else."</em><br></li>
					
					<li>On Official Instagram, she was called <em>"Mary Sibley: the queen of sacrifice."</em></li>
