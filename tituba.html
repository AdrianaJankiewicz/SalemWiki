But I close my eyes, and I can still see the green of my jungle and the deadly white of the Englishmen's faces. I had never seen skin like that, so white when we see them walking towards us, we think they are ghosts. Slavers. They slaughtered many of our men, chained the rest, and have their way with the women. I am too young to be of use to them, but my mother and sisters are not. And they forced me to watch. Later, in chains, I look back, and they're burning the huts of my village, and I see two red eyes staring back at me, out of the trees. And the red eyes speak to me, "Tituba, you are mine.</p>

		<div class="tx"><p> Tituba is a very powerful witch who served as a handmaiden to George and Mary Sibley. She was abducted and enslaved as a child and became a witch to avenge the molestation and murder of her family. She also wanted to free herself from the cruel and inhumane oppression that she received from the Europeans. <br>She is originally from Arawak tribe, which got invided by white men who killed most of the men who lived there, while raping and enslaving women and children. She was sold into slavery where she was heavily abused by all her masters, excep for the Walcott family. Despite all the cruelty from her masters, she was bought up with Christian Bible and was forced to believe in all-powerful nd benevolent God who loved all of his creation, but whenever she cried out for God to save her, he never did. Her life changed for better when Kanaima(devil) appeared to her in the woods. He cared for her, but also gave her powers and taught her everything about witchcraft. </p>

			<ul>
				<li>WGN America Salem official website described Tituba as: <em>"Mysterious and mysteriously ageless, Tituba is the indispensable helper to Mary Sibley, Salem’s most powerful woman. Tituba is ostensibly Mary’s servant in the Sibley household, but in private, behaves as if she’s Mary’s superior. There is a great deal of history between Tituba and Mary – they have experienced unthinkable deeds throughout the years. Although closely tied to Mary, the beautiful and exotic Tituba has powers and secrets all her own."</em></li>
			
				<li><br>The description given on official Instagram is as follows: <em>"Tituba: the mysterious handmaiden turned traitor."</em></li>
				
				<li><br>Historically, Tituba was the first to be accused of being a witch, but she was never executed. It is unknown what happened to her after the Salem Witch Trials.</li>
