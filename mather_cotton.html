		<div class="tx">
			<p>Cotton Mather is one of the main male characters of Salem. He is a well-educated aristocrat who worsens Salem's witch hunt. He is an expert on witches and malice, he is also Puritan Reverend, son of the witch hunter Increase Mather. Cotton is a man of contradiction. He is a big believer in God and yet he has his own demons that make him too afraid to exorcise. <br> Not much is know about his past, but from what John Alden said, Cotton wore "feminine" clothing when he was a child. While his friends went to war or built a career, Cotton was sent to study theology at Harvard University. </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Cotton's description on the main WGN America website says: <em>"Well educated aristocrat and former reverend, Cotton Mather finds himself married to a witch and is trying to find a way to escape, which is hard to do with Brown Jenkins eating his insides every time he does something wrong."</em></li>

				<li><br>Cotton Mather is based on the real Cotton Mather who influenced New England both socially and politically. He was a Puritan minister, prolific author and pamphleteer.</li>
			
				<li><br>The description given on Official Instagram with the promotional photos of the third season, reads as follows: <em>"Cotton Mather: the reverend of a people destined for Hell."</em></li>
